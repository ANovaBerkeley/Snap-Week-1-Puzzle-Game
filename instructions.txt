Puzzle Path Project

Problem: Turtle sprite needs to navigate maze to get points and win the prize at the finish line

1. In order to complete the maze, the sprite must go to stage 1, then stage 2, then the finish square (50 Points!).
- Create instructions to move Turtle Sprite from Start to Finish through stages 1 and 2.
- The path you make MUST also use the blocks 'move_to_200_0' and 'move_to_100_40_rotate'.
- Use 'update_score' every time you move to see your score change!

2. As Turtle's PE Coach says, "Run through the finish line!" 
- Go to the trophy next to finish for a score bonus of 100 points!

3. Bonus: Try to go to all the white squares for a bonus score! 
- Use 'update_score' every time you move to see your score change!

4. Bonus: Keep Turtle Sprite looking fresh!
- Give Turtle Sprite a new costume once it reaches a new stage!
